# Explainable Machine Learning using SHAP Values
Course Project as part of "Algorithmic Game Theory" course at IIT Kharagpur under Prof. Palash Dey<br> 
The objective of this project is to explain Logistic Regression and Random Forest models trained on Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset using two explainability methods - permutation importance and SHAP values.<br>
We find that SHAP explains the predictions in much more detail and with clarity.
